You can see the code used to process the 12-month Enrollent IPEDS report in __Utilizing R for IPEDS Reporting.Rmd__. The data is in the __data__ folder.

To use this project, first clone it to your desktop and unzip to a folder of your choice.

Make sure you have the `renv` package installed in your R environment using the command `install.packages("renv")`.

Open the project file (__2022-04-07 NCAIR Utilizing R for IPEDS Reporting.Rproj__).

From the command line, issue the following command to install the necessary packages in a local environment: `renv::restore()`

You can change the institution name and IPEDS number in the __config.yml__ file.
